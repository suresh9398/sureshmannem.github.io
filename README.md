<p>V Celluloids was established in the year 2014 with an objective of providing movie goers with the most satisfying cinematic experience. A strong team of professionals with nearly two decades of experience in film production and distribution having witnessed the travails of movie goers at town and rural level, felt that the experience of a film goer at town level was simply not satisfying unlike in cities where audiences have several choices. Resolving to work to change this situation, they established V Celluloids and began to explore the prospects of initiating the change. We believe that the experience of watching a movie has to be made enjoyable, comfortable, entertaining and relaxed to a viewer, which inevitably ensures that he returns for more, for a refreshingly wholesome experience. V Celluloids were the first players in regional cinema to introduce viewers many new experiences in Andhra and Telangana states.

<p>V Celluloid has been conceptualized and is promoted by Shri Vamsi Krishna Reddy Vemareddy and Shri Vikram Srinivas Reddy Vemareddy. With their wide ranging experiences with cinema for over 15 years, V Celluloids reflects a commitment to improve the Indian cinema experience to be on par with world class standards. A principal component of our promoters’ philosophy is the addition of something new and refreshing to film goers’ overall feel of a movie experience. With our promoters’ far sighted vision of bringing greatness to our cinema, it is inevitable that V Celluloids is certain to create ripples on a national scale and forever change the face of Indian movie industry. A move towards this is launching India’s largest screen at Sullurpet which will make viewers spellbound.

<p>While Qube will create specially mastered Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs) for select movies to be screened on EPIQ screens, there is also a suggestion for producers and cinematographers wanting to screen their films in the large format. “If cinematographers can shoot by providing for the 1:1.89 aspect ratio, their films can be screened in both standard and large formats,” pointed out R. Madhi who shot ‘Saaho’.

More importantly, what EPIQ does is bring in the immersive cinema experience to small towns which are otherwise short of high-quality entertainment. Vamsi Krishna, who owns the V Celluloid group and has taken his group’s 38 modern cinema screens to 17 towns in Andhra and Telangana within four years, is confident that cinema will expand only through smaller towns in India.

“Since big cities are already choked with multiplexes and combined with high land and rental costs, acquiring new screens is becoming less profitable. So, smaller towns and suburbs of metros will be the places to go. For example, this EPIQ screen would attract not just the town folks of Sullurpetta but also the residents of Sriharikota and Sri City (a large industrial and educational hub) located close by. Even residents of Chennai could drive down during the weekends to enjoy the cinema in this format,” said Vamsi. The EPIQ format would provide a new benchmark for film production and audience experience in India he said.V Epiq, the new cinema hall does justice to its name by sporting a 100X54 feet flat-screen claimed to be the largest in South Asia.

Constructed at a cost of Rs.10 crores, the 656-seater EPIQ screen packages state of the art technology like 4K RGB laser projection, Dolby Atmos Immersive Audio and a 1:1.89 aspect ratio that is optimised for both scope and flat movies with razor-sharp images, higher brightness, increased contrast and a wider colour gamut. The theatre was launched with the screening of “Saaho” on August 30, starring Prabhas and Shraddha.

“There may be similar premium large format cinema screens in China and South Korea, but this would definitely be the first in India,” said Senthil Kumar co-founder of Qube Cinema, which has installed the EPIQ screen.
